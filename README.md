## How to run the current project

The prerequisites in order to set the project on a local machine are:
* [Github](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)
* [Anaconda and python](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html)

1. Git clone the repository
   
   `git clone https://github.com/andreipop95/face-generation-gan.gitt`

2. Create a conda environment using python 3.5. As an alternative for package management, pip can be used

   `conda create --name <your_project_name> python=3.5`
   `source activate <your_project_name>`

3. Install needed packages
   
   `conda install <package_name_1 package_name_2...>`
   
4. Install jupyter notebook
   
   `conda install jupyter notebook`
 
5. Lunch the notebook
   
   `jupyter notebook dlnd_face_generation.ipynb`
